      <p>
        "Overwatch 2" is the highly anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking team-based shooter,
        "Overwatch." Announced by Blizzard Entertainment in November 2019, the sequel builds upon
        the success of the original game, introducing new maps, heroes, and a significant expansion
        in the form of story-driven PvE (Player vs Environment) missions. The game continues the
        narrative of the original, exploring the resurgence of the Overwatch team to face new global
        threats.

      <h1>How to Play Overwatch 2</h1>
      <p>
        &emsp;The core gameplay mechanics of "Overwatch 2" remain similar to its predecessor, with
        teams of five players working together to achieve objectives. New game modes have been
        introduced, along with visual upgrades and character redesigns. One of the standout
        additions is the cooperative PvE missions, allowing players to delve into the game's lore
        and fight AI-controlled enemies which will be introduced in the future years!
        <br /><br />&emsp; In PvP (Player vs Player) mode, teamwork, coordination, and understanding
        of each hero's unique abilities are essential. Players must strategize and adapt to
        different situations, employing a synergy of hero abilities to succeed in their missions or
        defeat the opposing team.
