      <h1>Tid Bit About Me</h1>
      <p>
        &emsp;Hi, my name is Raphael Antioquia, a proud native of Scarborough, with both of my
        parents hailing from the Philippines. Although I'm currently a registered nurse, I'm on
        leave to chase a new career path. As a mature student, my hobbies span from tennis and
        working out to playing video games and watching anime.
        <br /><br />
        &emsp;This semester, Overwatch became my obsession, partly because a wrist injury prevented
        me from playing tennis. Since its beta phase, I've become quite familiar with the game, even
        reaching a peak rank of Masters. My commitment to improving my gameplay and the cherished
        memories of playing with friends online have turned Overwatch into more than just a game for
        me—it was a passion and was a fond part of my daily life. That's why I would like to share
        it with you! I also, didn't realize I could've chose a non-video game option, aha. I was in
        too deep however.
